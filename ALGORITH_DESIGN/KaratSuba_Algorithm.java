//The algorithm reduces the multiplication of two n-digit numbers to 
//three multiplications of n/2-digit numbers1. This is achieved by splitting 
//each number into two halves and recursively applying the same process until 
//the numbers are small enough to be multiplied directly3.

//The key insight of the Karatsuba algorithm is that it performs fewer multiplications
//in each recursive step. While the traditional multiplication 
//algorithm performs four multiplications for two 2-digit numbers, the Karatsuba
//algorithm only performs three

//This makes the Karatsuba algorithm faster than the traditional multiplication algorithm,
//especially for large numbers. The time complexity of the Karatsuba algorithm is O(n^1.585),
//compared to O(n^2) for the traditional algorithm4.
